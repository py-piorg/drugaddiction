        <p style="font-size: 1em">
            There are a wide variety of substance and alcohol abuse services available to children and adults in Pennsylvania. Community substance abuse programs are administered through county program offices called single county authorities (SCAs).&nbsp;
            <span style="font-size: 1em; background-color: initial">The county</span><span style="font-size: 1em; background-color: initial">
        SCA determines a person's eligibility for service funding, assesses the
        need for treatment or other services, and makes referrals to appropriate
        programs to match treatment and/or service needs.</span

      In 2016, Governor Tom Wolf introduced the Centers of Excellence (COE) for
      Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) as one solution to the growing overdose crisis
      within the state. Forty-five were selected as&nbsp;centers including
      primary care practices, hospitals, Federally Qualified Health Centers,
      substance-use disorder (SUD) treatment providers, and SCAs. The COEs were
      designed to engage the community to identify all persons with OUD and make
      sure every person with OUD achieves optimal health. This means COEs take
      care of the whole person, including OUD treatment, physical health
      treatment, and mental health treatment such as anxiety or depression
      treatment. It also means that COEs provides hand-in-hand support to every
      person with OUD, including providing every person with OUD a peer who
      helps the person process all steps in the recovery process and providing
      every person with a community-based care management team who helps the
      person identify, organize, obtain, and sustain treatment/non-treatment
      resources.&nbsp;<br />
