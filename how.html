        <p class="step-text">
          For many people struggling with addiction, the toughest step
          toward recovery is the very first one: recognizing that you have
          a problem and deciding to make a change. It’s normal to feel
          uncertain about whether you’re ready to start recovery, or if
          you have what it takes to quit.

        <h2 class="heading-third">
          Think about your past attempts at recovery, if any. What worked?
          What didn’t?
        </h2>
        <p class="step-text">
          It’s also normal to feel conflicted about giving up your drug of
          choice, even when you know it’s causing problems in your life.
          Recovery requires time, motivation, and support, but by making a
          commitment to change, you can overcome your addiction and regain
          control of your life.

          Set specific, measurable goals, such as a start date or limits
          on your drug use.
        </h2>
        <p class="step-text">
          Your recovery doesn’t end at getting sober. Your brain still
          needs time to recover and rebuild connections that changed while
          you were addicted. During this rebuild, drug cravings can be
          intense. You can support your continued recovery by avoiding
          people, places, and situations that trigger your urge to use.

          Remove reminders of your addiction from your home, workplace,
          and other places you frequent.
        </h2>
        <p class="step-text">
          Even if you don’t have a problem with alcohol, drinking lowers
          inhibitions and impairs judgment, which can easily lead to a
          relapse. Drugs are often readily available and the temptation to
          use can be overpowering. Also avoid any other environments and
          situations that you associate with drug use.

        <h2 class="heading-third">
          Tell friends and family that you’re committing to recovery, and
          ask for their support.
        </h2>
        <p class="step-text">
          Having the support of friends and family members is an
          invaluable asset in recovery. If you’re reluctant to turn to
          your loved ones because you’ve let them down before, consider
          going to relationship counseling or family therapy.
