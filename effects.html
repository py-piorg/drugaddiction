<h2>Drugs are chemicals that affect the body and brain. Different drugs can have different
    effects. Some effects of drugs include health consequences that are long-lasting and permanent. They can even
    continue after a person has stopped taking the substance.

    There are a few ways a person can take drugs, including injection, inhalation and ingestion. Depending on how the
    drug is delivered, changes how drugs affect your body. For example, the injection of drugs directly into the
    bloodstream has an immediate impact, while ingestion has a delayed effect. But all misused drugs affect the brain.
    They cause large amounts of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that helps regulate our emotions, motivation and feelings
    of pleasure, to flood the brain and produce a “high.” Eventually, drugs can change how the brain works and interfere
    with a person’s ability to make choices, leading to intense cravings and compulsive drug use. Over time, this
    behavior can turn into a substance dependency, or drug addiction.

    Today, more than 7 million people suffer from an illicit drug disorder, and one in four deaths results from illicit
    drug use. In fact, more deaths, illnesses and disabilities are associated with drug abuse than any other preventable
    health condition. People suffering from drug and alcohol addiction also have a higher risk of unintentional
    injuries, accidents and domestic violence incidents.</h2>
